# Web-quizzaroo

-I created a basic html and css stylesheet

-I cerated javaScript to complete the needed criteria

-I made a timer that begins when you start the quiz and takes time away from the clocks when answered incorrectly

- I created questions that move to the next question when answered correctly

-When all the questions are answered correctly, then the game is over and you can enter your initials.
